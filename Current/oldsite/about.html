    <h2> About Us </h2>

<p>
<h4>Organization Mission:</h4>
The mission of the student organization Women In Computing (WiC) is to provide an academic, social, and pre-professional network to help connect and support their undergraduate females interested in computer science and related fields at Northwestern University.

<br/>
<h5>Group classifications: Special Interest group, Departmental group (EECS) </h5>
<br/>
                     
<h4>Background:</h4>
Women have been notoriously underrepresented in computing sciences in the past few decades in both the academic and professional workplace, even as other STEM-related fields have grown towards closing the gender gap. 
Women In Computing (WiC) will strive to provide an academic, pre-professional, and social support system to female undergraduates interested in learning more about computing sciences. It can feel isolating to not know m/any female upperclassmen, professors, or advisers to turn to for guidance. By developing a community, we can support each other through our shared experiences, and hopefully encourage underclassmen to consider pursuing a rewarding (and super fun!) field of study that they may have been otherwise deterred from.

<h4>Isn't there already a Northwestern chapter of Society of Women Engineers (SWE)? Why should WiC be formed if there is potential overlap with an existing student group?</h4>

<!--img class="right" src="images/pic1.jpg" width="130" height="160" alt=""-->

Although there is a NU chapter for Society of Women Engineers, a student can pursue either a BA or a BS in computer science, and thus SWE's goals do not encompass Weinberg non-engineering students. Additionally, computer science students have to deal with unique struggles, such as being the only major (other than Applied Math) within McCormick that is not ABET- accredited, yet still has to abide by certain curriculum restrictions and requirements without the additional distinction. Furthermore, according to Northwestern's 2011 ASEE profile, the majors under EECS (Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering) are the only majors in McCormick (other than Applied Math, with 25 male and 0 female students) with less than 20% female students (Average % of women per grade level is 8%, 13%, and 19%, respectively). At Northwestern, being a female in the EECS department is still a fundamentally different experience than that of other engineers, and thus warrants its own organization.
